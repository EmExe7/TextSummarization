# TextSummarization
## Project 2: Text Summarization
### Description<br>
This project aims to summarize long text documents into concise summaries using state-of-the-art transformer models. The summarization model processes text input and generates a shorter version while retaining essential information.

### Key Features<br>
* Integration with Transformers: Utilized Hugging Face's transformers library to load pre-trained models for summarization.
* Interactive App: Developed a user-friendly Streamlit application where users can input lengthy text for summarization.
